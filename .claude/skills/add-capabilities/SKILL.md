# Pracht Add Capabilities

A capability is a protocol-neutral operation (`docs/CAPABILITIES.md`). Every
projection runs the identical pipeline, so rules never diverge per transport:

```text
input validation → named middleware chain → run() → output validation
```

Registration is opt-in and private by default; loaders and API routes are never
inferred as capabilities, and an app with none ships no dispatch surface.

Non-Pracht app: use `createCapabilityHost()` and the signal-owned WebMCP
registrar. See <https://pracht.resynapse.dev/docs/standalone-capabilities>.

## Step 1: Decide the contract before writing code

Settle these with `AskUserQuestion` when the request is vague:

- **Name** — dot-separated segments (`notes.search`); this is the agent-visible
  identity and the MCP tool name (dots become underscores).
- **Effect** — `read`, `write`, or `destructive`. This drives confirmation
  gating, client revalidation, and MCP annotations. Classify honestly.
- **Exposure** — private (omit `expose`), `http`, `webmcp` (requires `http`),
  `mcp`.
- **Router** — manifest apps use a `defineApp({ capabilities })` key; pages apps
  auto-discover `src/capabilities/`, where each module declares
  `name: "notes.search"` (or takes its file stem) and the name must map back to
  its file with dots as hyphens (`notes-search.ts`). Step 4 covers the rest.
- **Authorization** — which named middleware runs, and whether the endpoint
  requires a verified agent (`agentPolicy: "require"`).

Exposure matrix the runtime, `defineCapability()`, and `pracht verify` all
enforce:

| Effect | `http` | `webmcp` | `mcp` |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | ----- |
| `read` / `write` | yes | yes (needs `http`) | yes (needs `agents.mcp`) |
| `destructive` | yes — always confirmation-gated | rejected | yes — needs `agents.mcp.destructive` **and** a registered approval store |

## Step 2: Install and scaffold

`create-pracht` does not add the package, because an app without capabilities
should not carry it:

```bash
npm install @pracht/capabilities
pracht generate capability --name notes.search --effect read --expose http,webmcp \
  --description "Find notes whose title or body matches the query."
```

The generator writes and registers `src/capabilities/notes-search.ts`.
`--description` is required with `--expose`; the MCP `generate_capability` tool
has the same contract.

If dispatch answers `500 internal_error` and `pracht inspect capabilities`
prints capabilities as `unreadable`, the package is missing — that is the
symptom.

## Step 3: Write the capability

```ts
// src/capabilities/notes-search.ts
import { defineCapability, type CapabilityRunArgs } from "@pracht/capabilities";
import { searchNotes } from "../server/notes-store.ts";

interface SearchInput {
  query: string;
  limit: number;
}

export default defineCapability({
  title: "Search notes",
  description: "Find notes whose title or body matches the query.",
  input: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      query: { type: "string", minLength: 1 },
      limit: { type: "integer", minimum: 1, maximum: 20, default: 10 },
    },
    required: ["query"],
    additionalProperties: false,
  },
  output: {
    type: "object",
    properties: { notes: { type: "array", items: { type: "object" } } },
    required: ["notes"],
  },
  effect: "read",
  middleware: ["auth"],            // names from the app manifest
  expose: { http: true, webmcp: true },
  // webmcp: { untrustedContent: true } advertises untrustedContentHint for
  // page tools whose results carry user-generated content.
  // agentPolicy: "require",       // verified Web Bot Auth agents only —
  //                               // never combine with webmcp: page-tool
  //                               // calls are unsigned and would always 401
  async run({ input, context, request, signal }: CapabilityRunArgs<SearchInput>) {
    return { notes: searchNotes(input.query, input.limit) };
  },
});
```

Schema rules that bite:

- Only a **subset** of JSON Schema is accepted: `type`, `properties`,
  `required`, `additionalProperties`, `items` (single schema), `enum`, `const`,
  `minimum`, `maximum`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `default`, plus `title` and
  `description`. `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf`, `$ref`, `pattern`, `format`, and
  tuple `items` throw at definition time — a keyword the validator would ignore
  could widen what an exposed capability accepts.
- Inputs and outputs are JSON data only. `File`, `Blob`, `Date`, `Map`,
  `undefined`, and cycles are rejected — keep uploads in API routes.
- `expose` and `effect` must be **inline literals**. `input` and `output` may be
  Standard Schema + Standard JSON Schema validators such as Zod 4. Pracht
  derives the supported JSON subset server-side and runs the validator; async
  validation, defaults, and transforms work without adding it to WebMCP.
- MCP exposure additionally requires both schemas rooted at `type: "object"`.
- Annotate `run()` with `CapabilityRunArgs<Input>` so TypeScript still infers
  the output; `defineCapability<Input>` alone leaves the output `unknown`.

## Step 4: Register it, and configure `agents` only if needed

```ts
// src/routes.ts
import { defineApp, route } from "@pracht/core";

export const app = defineApp({
  capabilities: {
    "notes.search": () => import("./capabilities/notes-search.ts"),
  },
  agents: {
    // Verified agent identity (public keys — safe in the manifest).
    webBotAuth: { policy: "observe", directories: ["https://signature-agent.cloudflare.com"] },
    // Destructive prepare/commit tuning.
    confirmation: { ttlSeconds: 120 },
    // Remote MCP endpoint; without this, `expose.mcp` serves nothing.
    mcp: { serverInfo: { name: "notes", version: "1.0.0" }, instructions: "…" },
  },
  routes: [
    route("/notes", "./routes/notes.tsx", {
      // expose.webmcp makes it eligible; this makes it active on this page.
      capabilities: ["notes.search"],
    }),
  ],
});
```

Pages apps have no manifest: the same `capabilities` come from
`src/capabilities/` and the same `agents` object is `export const agents` in
`src/pages/_app.config.ts`. Activate WebMCP tools on each page that needs them:

```ts
// src/pages/notes.tsx
export const CAPABILITIES = ["notes.search"];
```

`CAPABILITIES` must be an inline array of non-empty registered names and cannot
appear on `_app` or `404`. In a manifest, group capability lists are additive.
Unknown names, capabilities without `expose.webmcp`, and activation on
`hydration: "none"` routes are rejected. Initial hydration registers the matched
route's set; every committed client navigation replaces it, so never assume a
tool exposed on one page persists globally.

Each `agents` sub-option is independent — add only what the app uses. Web Bot
Auth `policy: "require"` gates capability HTTP endpoints (not pages or API
routes) with `401 agent_required`; `agentPolicy: "require"` on a capability
fails closed even when `webBotAuth` is unconfigured.

### Authenticating the MCP endpoint (`agents.mcp.auth`)

`agents: { mcp: {} }` alone serves an **open** endpoint — anyone who can reach
the URL can call every `expose.mcp` tool, and authentication is whatever the
capability's named middleware does with the forwarded `Authorization` header.
That is fine for a public read surface and wrong for anything scoped to a user.

Add `auth` and `/mcp` becomes an OAuth 2.0 protected resource: pracht publishes
RFC 9728 metadata at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`, answers
unauthenticated calls with the `WWW-Authenticate` challenge MCP hosts follow,
and calls your `verify` module. This is what makes a real host (Claude, a
ChatGPT connector) able to connect at all.

```ts
mcp: {
  serverInfo: { name: "notes", version: "1.0.0" },
  auth: {
    resource: "https://app.example.com/mcp",       // absolute; token audience
    authorizationServers: ["https://auth.example.com"],
    scopesSupported: ["notes.read", "notes.write"],
    requiredScopes: ["notes.read"],                // optional per-request gate
    verify: () => import("./server/mcp-token.ts"), // server-only module
  },
},
```

Rules to hold the user to:

- **`verify` is a module reference, never an inline function.** The manifest is
  bundled into the client; a JWKS client in it would ship to every visitor.
  Put the module in `src/server/` and default-export the verifier function. It
  must live under `src/server/`, `src/middleware/`, or `src/capabilities/` —
  those are the only directories the build globs into the module registry, and
  a verifier anywhere else is never loadable, so every `/mcp` request 401s
  forever. `pracht verify` errors on that, but do not create the file elsewhere.
  If the same suffix exists in more than one registry directory, lookup rejects
  it as ambiguous; use a root-relative reference such as
  `() => import("/src/server/mcp-token.ts")`.
- **Security option names are exact.** Unknown keys under `agents.mcp` and
  `agents.mcp.auth` are rejected instead of ignored; do not work around the
  error with casts. The MCP path must also differ from every explicit API route
  path, or `pracht verify` rejects the graph and the runtime fails closed with
  500 before the API handler can bypass MCP's gates.
- **Pracht is not an authorization server.** Do not offer to implement token
  issuance, refresh, or dynamic client registration — those belong to the
  user's identity provider. Write `verify` with their library (`jose` works on
  Workers and Vercel Edge) and **bind `audience` to the `resource` value**, or a
  token minted for another service on the same issuer is accepted.
- **It fails closed.** `null`, a throw, or a malformed principal all give
  `401 invalid_token`; a missing required scope gives `403 insufficient_scope`.
  When `requiredScopes` is set, every challenge advertises it so hosts request
  the right grant on the first authorization attempt. The verifier receives an
  independent request clone, so reading its JSON-RPC body does not consume the
  body that MCP dispatch reads next.
- **The principal is `context.tokenAuth`** — a frozen `{ subject, scopes?,
  clientId?, claims? }`, alongside `context.agent`. Use it in named middleware
  and `run()` for authorization; the framework only authenticates. Nested calls
  retain the transport-verified principal. Capture it separately when audit
  events must identify the account.
- `resource` must be the endpoint's **real deployed URL**: absolute, free of
  query/fragment and exactly matching the deployed MCP path, including the app
  base (`https://app.example.com/app/mcp`). Use HTTPS outside loopback.
  `resolveApp()` and `pracht verify` reject malformed values and scope strings;
  mismatched authenticated request URLs redirect to the canonical resource.
- The bare `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` path is reserved for
  discovery and cannot be used as `mcp.path`. Production adapters route both
  metadata forms ahead of copied static files.
- `pracht plan` snapshots the OAuth policy separately from the endpoint path.
  Removing `auth` or a required scope, or trusting another authorization server,
  is a guard weakening even when `/mcp` itself did not move.

See `docs/REMOTE_MCP.md` for the metadata document and the full `verify` recipe.

## Step 5: Destructive capabilities

`destructive` (delete, publish, pay, send, change access) may be exposed over
`http` and `mcp`, never `webmcp`, and every dispatch is gated:

1. Set `PRACHT_CONFIRMATION_SECRET` in the server environment (or call
   `setCapabilityConfirmationSecret()` from `@pracht/core/server`). Without it,
   calls fail closed with `403 confirmation_unavailable` and `pracht verify`
   fails — verify reads the environment, so the variable must be set even when
   the app registers the secret programmatically.
2. A call without a token answers `409 confirmation_required` with a token
   bound to principal + capability + canonical input + expiry.
3. The commit repeats the call with byte-identical input plus the confirmation
   header.

Be honest about what this buys, and say so to the user
(`docs/AGENT_TRUST.md`): stateless HMAC cannot prevent replay inside the TTL,
the calling agent can hand the token back to itself, and without Web Bot Auth
or `setCapabilityApprovalPrincipalResolver()` both phases run as `"anonymous"`.
Register a `CapabilityApprovalStore` for exactly-once commits, and
`confirmation: { mode: "human" }` for a real human decision — that mode fails
closed without both a store and an authenticated principal.

`createSqlApprovalStore({ execute })` from `@pracht/core/server` is the
first-party durable store — one implementation for Postgres, Cloudflare D1, and
SQLite/Turso. Pass a parameterized-query function and run the migration from
`docs/AGENT_TRUST.md`; use `dialect: "postgres"` for `$1` placeholders.
`createMemoryApprovalStore()` is for tests only. A non-SQL backend needs atomic
conditional writes (Durable Objects, Redis — not Cloudflare KV).

### Destructive over remote MCP

Off by default. To serve one:

1. `agents: { mcp: { destructive: true } }` in `defineApp()`.
2. Register an approval store from a server entry or a capability module, so it
   exists before the graph is served — a token handed to the committing agent
   must be consumable exactly once. The endpoint refuses to serve at all when
   the store, `PRACHT_CONFIRMATION_SECRET`, or (in human mode) any resolvable
   principal is missing; `pracht verify` warns when it cannot find the
   registration in the configured source directories.
3. The flow is unchanged; only the channel differs. Prepare answers
   `isError: true` with the token in `_meta["io.pracht/error"]`, and the commit
   repeats `tools/call` with identical `arguments` plus
   `_meta["io.pracht/confirmation"]`.

Nested `invokeCapability()` under an MCP tool still refuses destructive callees
unless the served tool is itself a destructive capability that already cleared
prepare/commit.

## Step 6: Call it

```ts
// Server: loaders, API routes, middleware — works for private capabilities too.
import { invokeCapability } from "@pracht/core/server";
const result = await invokeCapability("notes.search", { query: "roadmap" }, { request, context, signal });
```

```ts
// Browser: generated, typed, http-exposed names only.
import { capabilities, useCapability } from "virtual:pracht/capabilities";
const result = await capabilities.notes.search({ query: "roadmap" });
```

Unresolvable in TS? Add `"@pracht/vite-plugin/virtual"` to tsconfig `types`.

```tsx
// One contract for the human form and the agent tool.
<Form capability="notes.create" onCapabilityResult={(result) => { /* … */ }}>
  <input name="title" />
  <button type="submit">Create</button>
</Form>
```

- Prefer a loader + `invokeCapability()` for data a page needs on load;
  `useCapability()` dispatches on interaction, never during render.
- After a successful non-`read` call the route's data revalidates
  automatically (`revalidate: false` opts out).
- Capability modules are server-only: importing one from client code is a build
  error, because nothing would strip `run()` and its database client out of the
  browser bundle.

## Step 7: Types, inspection, and proof

```bash
pracht typegen                 # emits src/pracht-capabilities.d.ts
pracht inspect capabilities --json
pracht verify --json           # contract, exposure, and projection checks
pracht eval --start "pracht preview"
```

Once the declaration exists the compiler rejects unknown names, bad input,
browser calls to private capabilities, destructive calls without
`prepare`/`confirm`, and computed names (assert `as HttpCapabilityName`).
Re-run `pracht typegen --check` in CI.

`pracht eval` runs JSON scenarios against the live app and exits 1 on a failed
expectation. Steps can reference earlier results
(`$steps[0].error.confirmationToken`); a scenario-level `signAs` block signs
every step as a verified agent.

A scenario targets HTTP by default; scenario-level `"transport": "mcp"` runs
the same steps over the remote MCP endpoint (`initialize`, then one
`tools/call` per step, names mapped `notes.search` → `notes_search`). Write one
of each for any `expose.mcp` capability — passing over HTTP does not prove an
MCP host can reach it.
If `agents.mcp.auth` protects the endpoint, add scenario-level
`"mcpHeaders": { "authorization": "Bearer …" }`; it applies to `initialize` and
every later request, and step-level `headers.authorization` overrides it for
one call. Inject test tokens in CI. Expectations are portable: `expect.status`
is the capability dispatch status on both transports.

Three MCP limits fail loudly: a step for a capability without `expose.mcp`, a
step header other than `authorization` (the projection forwards nothing else),
and a destructive step whose app has not enabled `agents.mcp.destructive` with
an approval store. For an exposed destructive MCP tool, `confirm` completes the
same prepare/commit round trip as HTTP, with the token in the call's
`_meta["io.pracht/confirmation"]`.

`createCapabilityTestHost()` from `@pracht/core` covers the same pipeline in
unit tests, without a server.

WebMCP specifics `pracht verify` checks: tool names must fit the spec's
grammar (1–128 ASCII `[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]`); an effective `agentPolicy: "require"`
makes a page tool dead (unsigned browser fetches always 401 — warned);
descriptions have advisory budgets (~500 chars per tool, ~150 per schema
parameter). Hosts: the ChatGPT desktop browser enables the API itself, but
stable Chrome/Edge visitors only get `document.modelContext` if the page head
carries an origin-trial token — the docs site's capabilities page shows the
shell `head()` recipe.

To audit what the whole agent surface exposes, run `/audit-agent-surface`.

## Rules

1. Never expose a `destructive` capability over `webmcp`; expose it over `mcp`
   only with `agents.mcp.destructive` and a durable approval store, and say so
   to the user. Never reclassify a destructive operation as `write` to escape
   the confirmation gate.
2. Never widen a schema (drop `required`, open `additionalProperties`, raise a
   `maximum`) without saying so — `pracht plan` reports it as a widening of the
   agent-reachable surface for a reason.
3. Keep `expose` and `effect` inline; reuse a Standard JSON Schema validator for
   `input`/`output` when the app already has one.
4. Treat `expose.webmcp` as eligibility, not activation. Add the capability to
   only the manifest routes/groups or Pages `CAPABILITIES` exports where an
   in-page agent should see it.
5. Put authentication, authorization, and rate limiting in named middleware —
   the framework ships no rate limiting, no write-idempotency helper, and no
   result-size budget. Bound outputs with a `limit` input and a schema
   `maximum`.
6. Design `write` inputs to be safely repeatable; agents retry, and only
   `destructive` calls are token-gated.
7. Never register an app-wide approval endpoint or UI without your own
   authorization — who may approve is an application decision.
8. Re-run `pracht typegen` after changing a schema, name, exposure, or route activation, and
   `pracht verify` before committing.
